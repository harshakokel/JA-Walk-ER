Step to publish.

-- Try to enable multi instance of DE. The tempimg is a problem.
++ Big string dialog allow '\"'
++ Insert dialog add label edit.
++ colorscheme, arrowtype, etc in different platform need control window size to show more.
++ Some logic improve in add dialog.
++ "node" and "nodesep" is different keyword in script editor.
++ style attr should be tuple! 
++ enum_image pg, include "color_scheme", "node_shape"
++ color pg.
++ arrow shape pg. Haaaa!
++ Backup old graph file when save it.
-- Show helps in preview window :)
++ Add GPL declaration.
++ About Dialog. Maybe still use preview window.
-- Pop alert when script changed and user cancel or close the script dialog.
++ Highlight the source code panel. Maybe scintilla is a good choice.
++ Dot Editor Icon and Logo.
++ Move wildcard item to the beginning of graph.
++ Keyboard shortcut.
++ Zoom and pan
-- Restruct all attrs group. Keep mostly used attr on upside.
-- Test, fix bugs.
-- some connect between fillcolor -> styled.filled, plaintext -> styled.filled
++ Create temp files in system-temp-directory and delete them when exit.
++ Check graphviz installed when start DE.

++ Label pg need bigger editor.

limited feature.
-- The wildcard 'node' and 'edge' exists only one-copy in each graph/subgraph.
-- From Pydot: double quote can't be use in quoted string such as name or label.

plan:

-- Drag and drop in tree.
-- Undo, redo
-- May be graph/subgraph/cluster attrs should be different.
-- Maybe build a distribution include graphviz binary.
-- layout attr of graph.
-- colorList value in color attr.
++ Upload to Github.
++ Build a small web page to publish.
-- Add comment to script.
-- Maybe can replace preview with brower-window to preview in SVG format.
-- Change the kernel of dot parser. Such as pygraphviz or gv_python


Next features:

-- Open file when draged into main window.
-- Maybe can change node/edge name to strip it.
-- Some fast Dialog such like: Graph most-used params Dialog, Add nodes dialog, Add edges dialog.
-- Use cPickle to store graph object instead of use dot script format.
-- Rightclick menu.
++ subgraph!

++ Default template of new graph.

-- Inline help. Maybe some issue can link to graphviz web site.
++ Layout: circo, dot, fdp, neato, osage, sfdp, twopi !!! osage, sfdp is disable by pydot, so~
++ Digraph, graph switch. Maybe should add a panel to set at the same time as Layout.
++ Folder group at the beginning in propgrid.
++ Replace textctrl with combobox in append item dialog.
-- i18n
++ Exprot more format.

bug:

-- Screen blink in script dialog when script very large.
-- All comment in dot missed after parsing.
++ Wildcard "node" and "edge" nodes append at the end of graph
++ "strict" missed anyway. 
++ Not allow to append empty node and empty edge.
++ Report error when changed graph wildcard attr and NO "graph" item in data graph. 
++ Done! can't find unicode edge when parse script dialog process graph.
++ The script parser split unicode Node into N parts if the node name included both unicode and number and ascii string.
